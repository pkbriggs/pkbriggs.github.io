My roommate and I created it in early 2013 but it continues to teach people to this day.", "While my roommate and I did not have concrete roles, I generally focused more on the back-end and infrastructure while he focused mostly on the front-end. In addition to these focuses, we both spent a great deal of time user testing and negotiating referral deals with other Bitcoin companies.")
